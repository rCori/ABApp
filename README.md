The most ballin android soundboard ever made. A soundboard that confines to the strict guidelines of ABAP
My tribute project to Chad Warden.

This was just a fun project I cooked up in my free time. I have no plans to monetize this.
I will put it on google play store at some point, but if you want to mess with it now feel
free to download this and build the apk yourself. There should be an .apk in the /bin/ folder
if you want to use that that instead. If you want to distribute any of this work to your
friends or even host a download to it somewhere else, go ahead. I do request I am givin credit
for it. Basically pircacy is not an issue, this is a free thing. Plagarism is not cool. That's
my distrobution license I guess.

Not much to say about this. It was a joke that go tossed around some friends that I decided to
take too far. I wanted some extra experience with android development and requirements for
actual publishing. I also wanted it to work and look right on different devices which is something
I hadn't dealt with in android development.

I do not own the rights too, nor even know Chad Warden. I can only hope he is still ballin'. 
If he were to raise a problem with this, I would have no problem taking it down. I do not
want to ruffle any slick-black hair rollin in a caddy with the PSTripple.
